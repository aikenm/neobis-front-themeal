## Features

**The Meal DB** is a dynamic web application that provides users with the ability to explore a wide variety of meals using the extensive database offered by the https://www.themealdb.com API. The project is built using React, utilizing the react-router-dom library for seamless navigation between different sections of the app and Axios for making API requests.

- **Main Page:**

  The main page of the app welcomes users with a header, a "Meal of the Day" section, a search block, and a meal list. The "Meal of the Day" section showcases a randomly selected meal's image, name, category, and country. Users can click on the meal name to view its detailed ingredients and instructions on a separate page.

- **Search Functionality:**

  The search block empowers users to find specific meals by entering keywords. Each displayed meal is presented with its image, name, category, and country.

- **Meal List:**

  The meal list section showcases a range of meals based on user interactions. If a user searches for specific keywords or clicks on a category, a list of related meals is displayed. Users can click on any meal from the list to view its detailed ingredients and instructions.

- **Ingredients Page:**

  When a user clicks on a meal's name from the main page or meal list, they are directed to the ingredients page. This page provides comprehensive information about the selected meal, including a list of ingredients and detailed cooking instructions.

- **Navigation:**

  Users can seamlessly navigate between the main page and ingredients page using the header logo. This feature offers a smooth transition between exploring different meals and returning to the main page.
